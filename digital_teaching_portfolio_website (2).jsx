                Hello! My name is Stephen Conte, and I am a teacher candidate in Family and Consumer Sciences: Secondary Education at Illinois State University. My path into education has been shaped by classroom experiences, leadership opportunities, professional service, research, and my work in behavioral services, but it is also deeply personal. As someone whose life was shaped by loss, resilience, and the influence of caring educators, I have developed a strong sense of purpose around becoming the kind of teacher who helps students feel supported, capable, and seen.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-8 text-slate-700">
                What makes me different is the combination of my teacher preparation background and my work in Applied Behavior Analysis, along with how actively I engage in the professional world of Family and Consumer Sciences. I recently served as an FCCLA judge and attended the IACTE conference in February, experiences that strengthened my understanding of student leadership, career and technical education, and the larger professional community I am preparing to join. I also carry with me the perspective of someone who once benefited from extra support in school and now wants to give that same encouragement back to students. I want my future classroom to feel engaging, respectful, ambitious, and connected to real life in ways that help students build confidence, practical skills, and a stronger sense of who they are.

          <h3 className="mt-2 text-3xl font-bold">What I Believe About Teaching and Learning</h3>
          <p className="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-sm leading-7 text-slate-600">My philosophy is rooted in connection, inclusion, practical learning, and the belief that education should help students grow into thoughtful, capable people.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 rounded-3xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-8 shadow-sm">
            <p className="leading-8 text-slate-700">
              I believe meaningful learning happens when students feel seen, supported, and challenged to think critically. My experiences as a student, teacher candidate, and professional working in an Applied Behavior Analysis clinic have shown me the importance of patience, relationship-building, and adapting to individual student needs. My own life experiences have also taught me that students carry much more than academics into the classroom, and that the adults who show consistency, empathy, and belief in them can make a lasting difference. I want to create a classroom where diversity is valued, student identities are respected, and learning is connected to real life.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-8 text-slate-700">
              My philosophy is strongly influenced by social reconstructionism, which emphasizes education as a tool for positive social change. This perspective aligns closely with Family and Consumer Sciences because it helps students develop practical knowledge, critical thinking, and the ability to contribute to healthier and more equitable communities. I want my classroom to be a place where students not only learn content, but also learn how to make thoughtful decisions, understand others, and use their voices in meaningful ways.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-8 text-slate-700">
              As an educator, I aim to balance structure with empathy. I believe students learn best when they know their experiences matter and when instruction is responsive to their backgrounds, perspectives, and strengths. I especially want to serve students in ways that feel grounded, practical, and human by helping them connect what they learn in school to the realities of adulthood, relationships, career development, and personal growth. Above all, I hope to create a learning environment that encourages inclusivity, confidence, and growth while preparing students to succeed both in school and beyond.
